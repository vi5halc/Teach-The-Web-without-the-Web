# Teach The Web, Without The Web

The internet has become a crucial part of everyday life, but millions of people still lack the skills and resources to access it. This project is an effort to introduce solutions for communities with low/no connectivity to learn basic web skills. 

This project will help create a curriculum for communities with little or no internet connectivity, on how they can improve their web literacy skills and how they can take what they learn forward and spread web literacy in other regions as well, with the help of some simple resources and offline activities.


## Getting Started

If you are an Internet enthusiast and someone who is willing to help in the noble cause of educating others about the basics of Internet and the Web, this is for you. We will be designing certain activities and games through which people will learn about the basics of Web mechanics all the while having fun.
