# Teach The Web, Without The Web

The internet has become a crucial part of everyday life, but millions of people still lack the skills and resources to access it. This project is an effort to introduce solutions for communities with low/no connectivity to learn basic web skills. 


## Getting Started

If you are an Internet enthusiast and someone who is willing to help in the noble cause of educating others about the basics of Internet and the Web, this is for you. We will be designing certain activities and games through which people will learn about the basics of Web mechanics all the while having fun.
