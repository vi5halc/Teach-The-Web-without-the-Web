The internet has become a crucial part of everyday life, but millions of people still lack the skills and resources to access it. This project is an effort to introduce solutions for communities with low/no connectivity to learn basic web skills. 

This project will help create a curriculum for communities with little or no internet connectivity, on how they can improve their web literacy skills and how they can take what they learn forward and spread web literacy in other regions as well, with the help of some simple resources and offline activities.


## Getting Started

If you are an Internet enthusiast and someone who is willing to help in the noble cause of educating others about the basics of Internet and the Web, this is for you. We will be designing certain activities and games through which people will learn about the basics of Web mechanics all the while having fun.

## Vision / Mission Statement

> *We are working to create educational resources about the Internet and its concepts, even in the absence of any connectivity. Our goal is to convey basic knowledge about the Internet to people in the most remote places in the world, helping them to understand their role in shaping the Internet and, in turn, a better future.*
