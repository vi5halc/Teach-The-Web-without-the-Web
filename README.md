# Teach The Web, Without The Web

Hello "People"...

Welcome to my repo. My name is Vishal, I am from India. I run a startup, which basically deals with Internet on a day-to-day basis.

This project is for those people who want to spread awareness about Internet and it's benefits. But here we will be doing things the 'old-fashioned' way. By that, I mean we will be coming up with answers to the some of the most important question in the world..

> * *What will happen if there is no Internet?*
> * *How can we talk about Internet when there is no Connectivity?*
> * *Can we educate people about Internet without an actual Internet connection?*

## About this project

The internet has become a crucial part of everyday life, but millions of people still lack the skills and resources to access it. This project is an effort to introduce solutions for communities with low/no connectivity to learn basic web skills. 

This project will help create a curriculum for communities with little or no internet connectivity. The curriculum will consist of various activities, games of teaching methodologies. These will primarily focus on how people involved can improve their web literacy skills. This project also aims at collaborating with people around the world. As this ideology goes on a global platform, we can get more inputs and unique suggestions which can help design curricumlums or educational content which would cater to different regions around the world.
